# AI FOR HEALTHCARE-Nanodegree Project

## Project 1: Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays

In this project, you will apply the skills that you have acquired in this 2D medical imaging course to analyze data from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and train a CNN to classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence of pneumonia. This project will culminate in a model that can predict the presence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy that can be prepared for submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance as software as a medical device. As part of the submission preparation, you will formally describe your model, the data that it was trained on, and a validation plan that meets FDA criteria.
